<p>Chris was a Southern California boy who ran cross-country, attended
an all-boys Catholic high school (shenanigans ensued), and
perfected his image as the “chill smart guy”.  Nikita was a
Midwestern girl, a dancer, musician, and hopeful writer who
embodied every stereotype of the over-achiever.  A pair of
acceptance letters brought them together to that special place
between the foothills and the bay – Stanford University.  But they
didn’t meet until nearly a year later, when Nikita’s Indian
dance co-captain and Chris’ then-roommate introduced them. Love
at first sight it was not, but after a rocky start Chris
realized that this girl was too special to let go.  Nikita,
being the precocious person she is, had long since come to the
same conclusion. They happily embarked on the adventure known
commonly as The College Relationship.</p>

<p>As they progressed through their college years, Chris studying
computer science and Nikita the Classics, they grew up together.
They reveled in their mutual silliness, embraced each others’
friends as their own, and danced late into the night at parties
Chris would DJ.  They faced the typical challenges – Nikita
studying abroad in Athens, Chris working long hours on
computer-sciencey projects - but they found that facing them
together was more fun than going at it alone. By graduation,
they were inseparable. After getting their diplomas, Chris dove
into the startup world of Silicon Valley while Nikita finally
faced the fact that she could no longer rebel against her dreams
to be a doctor.  They lived happily side-by-side and explored the
Bay Area, which they both came to love.  All was well.</p>

<p>Then Nikita got into medical school – in Chicago.  Chris, being
the true Californian that he is, barely knew where Chicago was.
So when Nikita suggested they continue their relationship
long-distance, he unknowingly acquiesced.  How hard could it be?
He soon discovered that Chicago was indeed a great distance away,
but neither the distance (nor the cold) stopped him from visiting
Nikita as she buried herself in medical school at UIC. After 2½
years of flying back and forth (oh the miles!), Chris finally took
the plunge and moved to Chicago to be with his girl.  Slowly but
surely, they built a life together in Chicago – exploring the
city’s amazing restaurants, running through Millenium Park, and
investing in Chris’ first winter coat. Soon enough, Chicago felt
like a second home.</p>

<p>Chris decided he wanted to propose to Nikita soon after he moved
to Chicago.  He decided to propose where their relationship began
– at their 5-year Stanford reunion. With the help of his parents,
he chose a ring on a family trip to Hong Kong and hid it in his
closet for months. He coordinated with Nikita’s girlfriends to
come up with the perfect proposal. True to form, Nikita repeatedly
changed her plans that weekend, forcing Chris to adjust and
re-adjust his proposal. On the final morning of reunion weekend,
Nikita set out on foot to meet a friend at the Oval to take some
engagement pictures for her and her new fiancé (the latest ruse).
Little did she know that her friends were waiting around the
corner to whisk Chris over to the Oval by car.  Nikita obliviously
walked to the Oval, where she found Chris waiting for her.  Chris
nervously rushed through his speech, maneuvering Nikita around the
crowd of tourists that had suddenly appeared, and got down on one
knee. Nikita started blubbering, but made sure to say an audible
“yes” before he slipped the ring on her finger.  Nikita’s friends
poured out of their cars, where they had been surreptitiously
recording the whole event on their phones. And, just like that,
they started the countdown to #BacligVashi2016.</p>
