            <h2>The Couple</h2>
            <p>Shelley and Ted's story begins like any other love story has since the beginning of time. They took one
                look at each other and <em>swiped right</em>. They had to swipe right, because it was the summer of 2020
                and no one could meet in person.
                After an agonizing month, they were able to meet in person. They had their first in person date on a
                <strong>hot, 105â„‰</strong>, August afternoon at a city park where they talked for hours, completely
                neglecting the fact that they both drank through their half gallon water bottles and were quickly
                shriveling due to dehydration. They knew
                they needed to see each other again.
            </p>
            <p>From there they went mini golfing, late night video chatting, mini golfing, in person chatting, mini
                golfing, cooked dinners for each other, and went on dates at any open business that would allow them to
                loiter.
            </p>
            <p>Ted knew Shelley was his one and only during their second mini golfing outing when she sank a second
                hole-in-one and didn't rub it in too much. ;)</p>
            <p>Shelley also knew that Ted was her one and only during their second mini golfing outing when he allowed
                her to go on and on about Disneyland which she is known to do.</p>
            <p>Everyone knows that Shelley hates surprises, so, Ted asked if he were to propose, how Shelley would want
                it to happen (while driving to a work bowling outing). Her response, "you could ask right now and I
                would probably say yes". Ted smiled,
                but he didn't ask. When they got home, Shelley started giving Ted "hints" as to the ring style (by
                showing him an exact ring and saying this one please).</p>
            <p>Fast forward to their Winter trip to Maine. On New Year's Eve, Shelley and Ted were a few hours early to
                meet Ted's parents for Shelley's first hockey game. They decided to go to the Maine Mall (the only thing
                open in Portland at the time)
                and ended up in a jewelry store. Ted let Shelley lead the way to the perfect ring. When the two got back
                to the car, Ted asked Shelley if he could see the ring box. He then asked Shelley to marry him. Through
                tears, Shelley said YES!</p>
            <p>The two now can't wait to walk down the aisle and party with their friends and family.</p>
